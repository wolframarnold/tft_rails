Description:
    Wraps up Test-First Teaching exercises adapted from Chapter 10 of the RailsTutorial by Michael Hartl.

Example:
    rails generate chapter10:solutions

    This copies the solutions and other necessary files (e.g. images, assets, helpers, etc.) into the project
    to conclude Chapter 10. This should make all tests pass and bring you in sync to the application at
    the end of Chapter 10.

    If you already have a solution file, you'll be prompted whether you want to overwrite your file,
    see the difference, or keep your file.

    It's a good idea to commit your changes to git, prior to running finish, in case you accidentally choose to
    overwrite files you wanted to keep. Assuming your project is already git-controlled, you can commit changes with:

    git add .
    git commit -m "comment here explaining WHY you made the changes"

Description:
    Generates Test-First Teaching exercises and solutions for chapters from RailsTutorial by Michael Hartl.

    The idea of Test-First Teaching exercises is that students get a series
    of tests which fail, and the exercise consists of students making the tests
    pass by implementing code.

    Each chapter comes with 2 generators: One to generate the tests and, in some
    cases, also CSS and view files with placeholder content. The other to fill
    in the solutions to make the specs pass for that chapter.

    Each chapter also comes with an instruction file that's generated into the `doc`.

    The generates for each chapter are assumed to be run in successive order.
    Running the `solutions` generator is not necessary if all specs pass.

Example:
    rails generate tft_rails:chapter07_begin
    rails generate tft_rails:chapter07_solutions

    When running the solutions generator, it'll prompt before overwriting anything,
    choose 'd' to view a diff, 'h' for more help.

    Before running `solutions` or the next chapter's `begin` generator it is recommended
    to commit the changes to source control. With git:

    git add .
    git commit -m "check in comment"

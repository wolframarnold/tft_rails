Description:
    Begins Test-First Teaching exercises adapted from Chapter 07 of the RailsTutorial by Michael Hartl.

    Chapter 07 is the first chapter covered, because the application built herein is an adaptation from
    RailsTutorial and uses the Devise authentication gem, rather than the home-grown solution from RailsTutorial.

    It is assumed that this generator is run in an freshly-created bare-bones Rails project.

    Successive chapters are expected to be run sequentially. Each chapter's generators comes with a delta
    to the next chapter, in two phase, the "begin" one will create tests, the "finish" one includes the solution files.
    If all tests pass, the "finish" phase is optional.

Example:
    rails generate chapter07:begin

    This copies new tests into the project, which are failing.
    The student's task is to write code to make the test pass. The material covered by the tests is consistent
    with Chapter 07 of the RailsTutorial.

    When you're done, and all tests pass, or you just want to skip ahead, run:

    rails generate chapter07:solutions

    This will copy solutions files into the application tree. If you already have a solution file,
    you'll be prompted whether you want to overwrite your file, see the difference, or keep your file.

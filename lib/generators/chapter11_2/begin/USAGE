Description:
    Begins Test-First Teaching exercises adapted from Chapter 11.2 of the RailsTutorial by Michael Hartl.

    It is assumed that this generator is run after the exercises for all prior chapters have been completed, and the solutions are implemented.

    Successive chapters are expected to be run sequentially. Each chapter's generators comes with a delta
    to the next chapter, in two phase, the "begin" one will create tests, the "finish" one includes the solution files.
    If all tests pass, the "finish" phase is optional.

Example:
    rails generate chapter11_2:begin

    This copies new tests into the project, which are failing.
    The student's task is to write code to make the test pass. The material covered by the tests is consistent
    with Chapter 11.2 of the RailsTutorial, however adapted for Devise as authentication solution.

    When you're done, and all tests pass, or you just want to skip ahead, run:

    rails generate chapter11_2:solutions

    This will copy solutions files into the application tree. If you already have a solution file,
    you'll be prompted whether you want to overwrite your file, see the difference, or keep your file.
